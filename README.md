# Dummy E-Commerce Website
"I developed a demo project aimed at enhancing my proficiency in Pinia , Tailwind CSS and foundational Nuxt.js concepts. 

I utilized Pinia store for efficient state management, allowing me to streamline data handling within the project. I developed a variety of UI components with customizable features through props, enhancing the project's modularity and flexibility. Additionally, I integrated external public APIs (such as Store API) to create dynamic sections within the web pages. Leveraging Nuxt's useFetch hook, I efficiently fetched and displayed data, contributing to the project's interactive elements and enriched user experience
.
The project encompasses essential pages such as homepage, signup, signin, and contact pages. 
The theme design is a clone of another application , serving as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of these technologies."
